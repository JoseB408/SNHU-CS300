1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course dealt with solving how to use different data structures (Vector, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Tree) and their appropriate usage within a software application.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I learned some of the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and applied the one best suited for my project.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame most roadblocks by doing two things. I used backtracing technqiues to go back on my older code and find the line that is not working as intended. After a lot of trial and error, I would find my mistake and change it accordingly. The other thing I did was do a lot of research when I couldn't figure out a hard roadblock. I used Stack Overflow and YouTube to help me solve my issue.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project showed me that it is important to think about performance when it comes to approaching algorithmic design and can be seen by making a big-O analysis.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   
The work I did in this project made me take pseudocode more seriously as it is a great planning tool used to visualize complex ideas and start writing solutions before the actual coding begins. I also tried to keep as much code out of the main function as possible to keep my main function very readable.
